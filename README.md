The percentage of paid 5-star reviews was 59%
The percentage of non-paid 5-star reviews was 54%

## Summary
Comparing the percentage of reviews that were 5 stars from both Vine members and non Vine members, it can be concluded that there is positivity bias for reviews of Shoes in the Vine program. The percentage of five-star reviews for Vine members shows a 5% increase compared to non Vine members. A similar analysis could be conducted to compare the one-star or low reviews from both Vine and non-Vine members to further support this conclusion.
